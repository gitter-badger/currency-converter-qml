Currency Converter TODO:

- Rewrite CurrencyModel inheriting QAbstractListModel and use
  QList<QLocale> allLocales = QLocale::matchingLocales(QLocale::AnyLanguage, QLocale::AnyScript, QLocale::AnyCountry);
  to get complete list. 
  Update: Qlocale doesn't have as good support as KLocale, so this won't be implemented.
- Better error checking and reporting. Use native notifications.
- Cache latest N exchange rates. Useful for when travelling with no internet connection.
